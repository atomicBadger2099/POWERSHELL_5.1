WINDOWS 10 LOGS AND EVENT RECORDS:



Logs are records of computer system events.

Logs fall into three general classifications on a Windows System:
  - Windows logs
  - applications and services logs
  - subscriptions logs

GUI - access logs by the event viewer
  (windows key + R - type eventvwr - enlarge logs window)
  (or type event viewer in dialog box.)

Windows logs may be one of 5 types:
  - application (related to software or applications on current system)
  - security (one of primary tools of tracking security breaches and problem solving)
  - setup (creates log files for all actions that occur during an Os installation)
  - system (inforamtion on hardware and software events that take place within a system)
  - forwarded events (events related to forwarding between hosts in a current system)

Applications and services logslist will depend on what applications are
active on the system.

A separate log set for subscriptions exists.

Security logs are *VERY IMPORTANT*. They are the first and last line of defense in a Windows system, 
  be int a local computer or a server.
