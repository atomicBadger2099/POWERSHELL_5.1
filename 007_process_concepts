process-a running program or application.

when a process runs, it takes up computer resources, CPU, RAM,ect.
The kernel manages this by creating , managing, and terminating processes in due order.

Processes run one at a time, in a section of time called a time slice.
Time slices happen so fast, that processes may appear to be happening simultaneously.
Processes appear to be happening at the same time. A process time slice is so fast it may be measured in milliseconds.

factors in a process's ability to run, or efficiency level:
  - number and allocation of resources of other running processes
  - RAM allocated or other engaged memory
  - capability of CPU

virtual memory - the combination of hard drive space and RAM allocated specifically for use by processes.
swap space - assigned virtual memory space on a hard drive.

I/O management:
  I/O devices are devices used to handle input/output tasks.

The operating system divides into several regions:
  user space - where the computer interacts with user.
  Userspace is performed either by GUI or CLI shells.
  Windows-Powershell, Linux-Bash

  kernel - manages processes, memory, files, and I/O tasks

drivers allow the hardware of a computer to interact with its software.
  hardware - the physical machinery of the computer, including peripherals and monitors
