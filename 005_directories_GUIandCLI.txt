GUI means graphical user interface.
	You are using the point and click graphical method to use Windows.

The typical Windows computer user learns how to function in the GUI first,
	then transfers those skills to command line (CLI).

Remember this, that Windows thinks in objects, whereas Linux thinks in files.

Paths in Windows:

*EVERY* folder or file has a path or location in an operating system. 
That path is its home location.

absolute path: the complete path from the main directory
relative path: path to a file or object from the current directory

Documents file folder in Windows 10 as an example:
C:\Users\milbu\Documents

Subdirectories are begun with backslashes in Windows(\).
In Linux subdirectories are begun with forward slashes (/).

form: C:Root\Branch\Branch\Branch

files can be hidden. This is common for some operating or configuration files.
  in Windows 10 GUI, go to view -> hidden items checkbox to see hidden items

in GUI, the properties of a file may be seen by right-clicking on the file and selecting properties.
Learn how to examine, use, and change the different properties related to folders and files.
